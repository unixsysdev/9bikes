# Serena Framework - Example Code Reference

## 📁 Purpose
The `serena/` directory contains the **Serena coding assistant framework** - this is **EXAMPLE CODE ONLY** and not part of our Claude Monitor System.

## 🔍 Why It's Here
- **Reference Implementation**: Shows how to build MCP servers and coding agents
- **Learning Resource**: Demonstrates best practices for:
  - MCP protocol implementation
  - Language server integration (LSP)
  - Tool-based agent frameworks
  - Symbolic code analysis
- **Template for Future Features**: May be useful for advanced monitoring capabilities

## 📋 What Serena Provides
- **MCP Server Framework**: Complete MCP protocol implementation
- **Semantic Code Tools**: LSP-based code analysis and editing
- **Agent Orchestration**: Tool coordination and workflow management
- **Multi-language Support**: Python, TypeScript, Java, Rust, etc.
- **Database Integration**: SQLAlchemy patterns and database tools

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **NOT our application code** - it's a separate project
- **Used as foundation**: We borrowed patterns for our MCP server
- **Can be removed later**: Once our system is complete
- **Read-only reference**: Don't modify this code

## 🔄 Future Decisions
- **Keep for now**: Useful reference during development
- **Remove later**: Once our monitor system is mature
- **Extract useful patterns**: Learn from their MCP implementation

## 📖 Serena Documentation
See `serena/README.md` for full documentation of the framework.

## 🎯 Our Code vs Serena
```
OUR CODE:           SERENA (EXAMPLE):
src/monitors_mcp/   serena/src/serena/
├── auth/           ├── mcp.py          # MCP patterns we borrowed
├── mcp_server/     ├── agent.py        # Agent framework examples  
├── monitors/       ├── tools/          # Tool implementation patterns
└── models.py       └── cli.py          # CLI structure we adapted
```

## 🔗 Relationship to Our Project
We adapted Serena's MCP server patterns for our monitoring system but built everything from scratch for our specific use case.
